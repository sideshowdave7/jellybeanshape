You want it to be like a mutual thing where everybody is everybody.
You know this.It is what life is.

Let's improve life. You have to experience life.
Look at this observation. There are infinite frequencies.

Don't decentralize the nature of yourself.
You are vast. This is a liberating moment.

You live in a world of things.  
Why blush?  It's an illusion.

You've heard that domestic subversion is a thing.
There is no better instrument than lies

Every event has infinite things.  
You struggle to comprehend the whole universe.

You can rule your arrogance and never tried to manipulate your image.
